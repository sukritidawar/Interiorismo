# Interiorismo
An AR project that helps people view how their furniture would look like in their room, without physically getting it and placing it. The application also has a tiles feature, that allows the user to checkout different floor textures.

It targets all the people who want to buy some new furniture and check whether the furniture would look good or not, or the people who are shifting to a new house.
